# Overview
This is a checklist project for Android Studio, and the programming language is Koltin. The program has three different functions. First, the input function can store four values in a list. When the list reaches five, the system will call an error. The second function can use the delete function to delete the value in the list. The third feature is the checkbox, and we call what we've done a cross.

The program is designed to help users organize shopping lists or to-do lists. The purpose of writing this software is to have better time management skills.
